        <p>Sixth-grader Maya and her family travel from America to Karachi, Pakistan, after her grandfather's death. Before leaving Pakistan, Maya, her older sister, Zara, and her grandmother take a trip to India to find a valuable chest hidden in her grandmother's childhood house. While in India, Maya's grandmother suffers a stroke. Maya and her sister must find the treasure on their own. Along the way, Maya not only finds what she was looking for but also her inner bravery and strength.</p>
